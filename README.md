# AI Product Manager Nanodegree Program

Successfully completed Udacity's AI Product Manager Nanodegree Program on March 31, 2020.

Built familiarity and fluency with common AI concepts. Learned how to evaluate the business value of an AI product, train a model, and evaluate its business impact.

I worked on these 3 projects:

- Designed a data annotation job to transform unstructured, unlabeled data, to a desired, labeled output that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images using Figure Eight's platform and a Kaggle chest x-ray dataset.
- Built a classification model that acts as a diagnostic aid for doctors to help them quickly identify cases of pneumonia using Google's #AutoML Vision Platform.
- Developed a business proposal for an AI product (business goal, success metrics, data, model, MVP, Post-MVP deployment).
